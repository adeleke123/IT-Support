## career path

I think I realized I could pursue this IT Support as a career my freshman year of high school. So I took an intro to computer applications class, and that's when we just learned about a lot of the very, very basics of computers. And our teacher always talked about how this is where the world is going, this is in 2001. And getting this foundational knowledge at a young age of 14, 15 is going to help you a lot when you're moving into college and leaving school and trying to get an actual job. Well, fortunately enough my first job was working with Google. I started here maybe a month after graduating and I was doing very, very entry level, low level tech support. One of the best memories or one of the best accomplishments I think I have from my IT Support job was training some of the new people in the program that I was a part of. I guess it's like a win knowing that not only myself who eventually left the program and went on to other things. People that I brought on, helped train, helped teach, have moved on and done better things.
